#Sandwich maker


## Description
For practice with iife syntax: Created a sandwich order form that allows the user to select all the ingredients for a custom deli sandwich. Created a Sandwich module, then create the following as individual modules, using IIFE syntax, to augment SandwichMaker: bread, meat, cheese, veggies, and condiments (which each have their own getters and setters). 

## How to run
After you clone the files, navigate to the correct directory in your terminal.
Then in your terminal run:
```
http-server -p 9999
```
then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser.
